Access Modifiers can be applied to:

1.Classes

2.Class members (variables, methods, constructors)

Types of Access Modifiers:

1. Private - class members marked private can only be accessed by their belonging class

2. Protected - class and class members marked protected can be accessed at package level 
               and also outside the package to inherited child classes inheriting it
               
3. Public - class and class members marked public can be accessed by any class or package 

4. <package> - if we don't use any modifiers, then <package> will be the default modifier
	           a. There is no specific keyword for package modifier 
	           b. class or class members with <package> modifier can be accessed within 
	           the package, any other class in the same package can access the class or 
	           the class members. Cannot be accessed outside that particular package.

	
Class = can only accept public or <package> modifier 
		a. if you mark a class private, then no other classes in the program can access it 
		   (making the class useless)
		b. protected keyword is used for inheritance, and this is used with class members,
		   not the actual class
		   
Blocks = we do not apply any access modifiers to blocks because we do not explicitly invoke
         the blocks, they're automatically executed by the JVM when an object is created or
         a class is loaded.
