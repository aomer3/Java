Inheritance Notes:

1. Child is able to use parent's methods, and child is able to use Object class methods 
	a. this is because of chain of inheritance (child > parent > object), 
	   also known as Class Hierarchy, where parent inherits from Object class implicitly 
	   
2. Child and parent class share same memory location

3. Method Overriding - Create method in child class with the same exact signature as the 
   Parent class. This will define a different functionality in the child method class.

4. Super keyword allows the child to access parent's class fields and methods

5. a. If no constructor exist in parent and child class, JVM creates both objects using the
   default constructor (creating parent object first, then child object).
   b. If a parameterized constructor exists in the parent class, the child class must also 
   create a parameterized constructor and then call the parent class.
   c. Super method can be placed in child constructor to call the parent constructor
   
6. With this() and super(), you can do constructor chaining, which is where one constructor
   calls another, then another, and so on. 
   this() = current class default constructor, super() = parent default constructor
   
7. Adding final to parent method will block parent methods from being overridden by child
8. a. Shadowing is when a parent class and child class have a field with the same name
   b. If you only use super() in the child constructor, only the parent field will have a 
   value and the child field will be null. 
   c. You must also use this keyword in child construtor below super() to store value for 
   child
