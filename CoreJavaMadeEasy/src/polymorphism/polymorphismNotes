Polymorphism Notes

1. Polymorphism - the ability for a class to behave differently when communicating with 
   other classes 
   
2 Types of Polymorphism 
1. Compile time polymorphism (static binding) - achieved through method overloading
	a. Method overloading - where we define same method name but different method signatures
2. Run time polymorphism (dynamic binding) - achieved through method overriding 
	b. Method overriding - where a child class overrides the implementation of a parent method
