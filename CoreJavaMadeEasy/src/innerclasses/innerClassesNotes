Inner Class Notes:
1. Inner classes are nested classes. They are classes that exist inside another class
2. They are of four types: static, non-static, local and anonymous inner classes
3. Anonymous inner classes allow for interfaces to be implemented with their original identity
4. Static, non-static, and local can have constructors but an anonymous class cannot have one
	a. this is b/c anonymous inner classes do not have class names of their own, and a class
	   name is needed to create a constructor
