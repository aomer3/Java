Reflections Notes:
1. an API that allows you to inspect and modify the behavior of a class dynamically at
   runtime
2. Using reflections, you can create a class dynamically, invoke the methods on it, and
   change its private fields (without using the getter and setter methods)
3. Java frameworks use reflections behind the scenes to be able to what they do (i.e. @test
   with Junit, dependecy injection with Spring, creation and executing of sql queries then creating
   objects and setting their values with Hibernate, servers creating servlets and the use of annotations)
