Regular Expressions Notes:
1. Allows you to pattern match and validate a group of Strings (like email, phone numbers, etc.)

Character classes = allow us to represent any character in a regular expression

[xyz] = either x, y or z can be used

[^xyz] = any other character, other than x,y or z can be used

[a-z] = any lowercase alphabet character can be used

[A-Z] = any uppercase alphabet character can be used

[a-zA-Z] = either lowercase or uppercase alphabet character can be used

[0-9] = any digit can be used 

[a-zA-Z0-9] = any alphabet character or number can be used

[^a-zA-Z0-9] = any other character, other than alphanumeric characters, can be used


Meta Characters = predefined character classes
\s = space character
\d = any digit, alternative to [0-9]
\w = any alphanumeric, alternative to [a-zA-Z0-9]
. = any special characters
\S = any character except space 
\D = any character except digits 
\W = any character except alphanumeric 

Quantifiers = restricts how many times a character can occur
x- = x can only occur once
x? = can occur 0 or 1 time 
x+ = can occur 1 or more times, but must be present at least once
x* = optional occurance, it can occur 0 or more times
