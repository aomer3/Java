Garbage Collection Notes
1. Each thread has 
	a. stack space - where local primitive types are stored
	b. heap space - where objects are stored 
	
2. Garbage collection 
	a. the process where the JVM clears the memory allocation of an object
	b. Garbage collector is a daemon thread that runs in the background
	c. Garbage collector collects objects when they are unreachable 
	d. Unreachable (example): an existing object A reassigns itself to a new object B, now 
	   object A is unreachable and the garbage collector will remove it from memory
	e. Unreachable (another example): if any object is set to null, it will be unreachable 
	f. Garbage collector cannot be forced to run, but it can be requested. To request, use 
	   System.gc()
