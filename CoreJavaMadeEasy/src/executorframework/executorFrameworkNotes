Executor Framework Notes


Limitations of traditional way of creating threads (Thread, Runnable):
1. Thread creation is time consuming 
2. Poor Resource Management (if the program creates many threads but only uses a few, the 
   other created threads will still be running but not actually doing any work)
3. Application is not robust - if too many threads are created, the program will crash due 
   to insufficient resources 
   
Executor Framework's solution
1. Introduces a thread pool
2. When a task-assigned thread finishes its task, instead of dying (like is the case 
   traditionally), it goes back to the thread pool to be reused 
3. Executor framework manages the lifecycle of the thread
