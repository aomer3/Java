Encapsulation Notes
1.Process of binding the class properties and methods together and hides the class fields,
  making them only accessible through class methods
	a. an object's class methods will be the only way to access that object's properties
2. To achieve encapsulation, use private keyword for class fields, and public keyword
   for class methods 
   
2 Advantages of Encapsulation 
1. Security - because class fields are private, you can only access them through class methods
		a. using methods to access fields allows for adding validations in those methods 
		   before setting values to the class fields 
2. Easy maintainability of code
