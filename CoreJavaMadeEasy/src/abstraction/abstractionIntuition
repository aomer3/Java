An abstract class can never be instantiated and this is the real advantage of the 
abstract class.

For example, the class Animal could be an abstract class; but in real life you can never 
have an instance of an Animal; that makes no sense at all as you can't just create 
an Animal. You can create a type of Animal, such as a Cat or Dog in real life as they are 
real-world entities. 

So in terms of the translation between the code design and the real-world concept 
or situation, abstract classes are much better as they can provide a much neater portrayal 
of the real-world situation.
