String Notes
1. String = collection of characters
2. String are Objects 

Immutability 
1. Strings once created cannot be changed, they're immutable
2. Two Advantages of immutability 	
	a. Performance
	b. Thread Safety - if two strings are pointing to the same single String in memory, and 
	   one String changes the value, it won't corrupt the data for the other String using that 
	   value, because Strings are immutable. A new String with the new value is simple created.
	   
String Pooling
1. Immutability is achieved by using string pools
2. JVM creates a special memory location for Strings called a String Pool
	a. if two Strings have values that are the same, both will reference the same single String
	   in the String pool
3. String pooling allows for better memory usage (String reusability) and increased performance
