StringBuffer and StringBuilder Notes:

1. StringBuffer and StringBuilder share the same methods with String
2. StringBuffer and StringBuilder have additional methods not found in String (i.e. reverse)


Differences between String, StringBuffer and StringBuilder

1. String is immutable. StringBuffer and StringBuilder are mutable
2. StringBuffer is synchronized (all the methods are synchronized). StringBuilder is not.
	if you want your strings to be mutalbe and:
	a. If you want the String to take care of multithreading for you, use StringBuffer, but
	   it will lower performance
	b. If you want to handle multithreading on your own, use StringBuilder
